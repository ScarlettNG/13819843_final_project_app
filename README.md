Make sure that you have ‘streamlit’ installed on your computer. If not, you can install it using this command:

Pip install streamlit


To install all required packages, after cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run: 

pip install -r requirements.txt


Navigate to the directory containing heart_disease_app.py.

Execute the following command:
streamlit run heart_disease_app.py

Or, if running on your PC with a specific directory path:
streamlit run \Your directory\heart_disease_app.py


Upon successful execution, a local server will start, and you should see a URL in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501/).
