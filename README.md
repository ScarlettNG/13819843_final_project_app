The heart of my web application lies in its mission to demystify heart disease for its users. With rising global incidences, there is an imperative need for individuals, especially the younger demographic and those proactive about their health, to comprehend the subtleties of heart conditions. Given this backdrop, our primary function crystallised - to provide an interactive platform that can educate users, allowing them to take charge of their health by interpreting potential heart disease indicators.

Instruction to Run The Heart Disease App Code on Your Personal Computer

• Make sure that you have ‘streamlit’ installed on your computer. If not, you can install it using this command:

Pip install streamlit

• Some requirements for the packages installed:

To install all required packages, after cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run: 
Numpy == 1.24.3
Pandas == 2.0.2
Scikit-learn == 1.2.2
Streamlit == 1.23.1
Joblib == 1.2.0
streamlit_option_menu
matplotlib
• Navigate to the directory where you have saved the ‘heart_disease_app.py’ directory. To run the code, please run this command in the terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Streamlit run 'heart_disease_app.py' or Streamlit run '\Your directory\heart_disease_app.py' if run on your PC.

• Once the command is executed successfully, a local will start and you should see a URL in the Command Prompt (usually ‘http://localhost:8501/’).

Navigate to the directory containing heart_disease_app.py.

Execute the following command:
streamlit run heart_disease_app.py

Or, if running on your PC with a specific directory path:
streamlit run \Your directory\heart_disease_app.py


Upon successful execution, a local server will start, and you should see a URL in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501/).

The predictive model and dataset analysis can be found in the heart_csv(Report) file located in the Dataset Analysis and Models folder.
